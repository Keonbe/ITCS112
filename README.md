# ITCS123 - Intermediate Programming Lab

## Introduction
This repository contains my Java implementations of fundamental programming concepts covered in the Intermediate Programming class at De La Salle University Dasmarinas.

## Course Description
This course includes review of control structures and data types with emphasis on structured data types. Application of object-oriented programming paradigm, focusing on the definition and use of classes along with the fundamentals of object-oriented design is also part of the discussion as well as basic analysis of algorithms, searching and sorting techniques.

# Overview  
The lab activity/repository covers the following core topics:  

### **1. Control Structures**  
- Review loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) and conditionals (`if-else`, `switch`).  
- Implement flow control for decision-making and repetition.  

### **2. Structured Data Types**  
- Differentiate between **primitive** (`int`, `char`) and **non-primitive** (`arrays`, `objects`) types.  
- Use data structures to organize and manipulate data.  

### **3. File Processing**  
- Read from and write to files using streams (`FileReader`, `BufferedWriter`).  
- Handle exceptions and manage file resources.  

### **4. User-Defined Methods & Classes**  
- Create reusable code blocks with custom methods.  
- Design classes to encapsulate data and behavior (OOP principles).  

### **5. Recursive Methods**  
- Implement recursive solutions for problems like factorial or Fibonacci.  
- Understand base cases and recursive calls to avoid stack overflow.  

### **6. Searching Algorithms**  
- **Linear search**: Iterate through elements sequentially.  
- **Binary search**: Divide-and-conquer approach for sorted data.  

### **7. Sorting Algorithms**  
- **Bubble sort**: Compare and swap adjacent elements.  
- **Selection sort**: Select the smallest element and swap.  
- **Insertion sort**: Build a sorted array one element at a time.
