# ITCS214 - Intermediate Programming Lab

## Introduction
This repository contains my Java implementations of fundamental programming concepts covered in the Intermediate Programming class at De La Salle University Dasmarinas.

## Course Description
This course includes review of control structures and data types with emphasis on structured data types. Application of object-oriented programming paradigm, focusing on the definition and use of classes along with the fundamentals of object-oriented design is also part of the discussion as well as basic analysis of algorithms, searching and sorting techniques.

## Course Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students are expected to:
- **CLO1**: Understand programming concepts
- **CLO2**: Describe structured data types
- **CLO3**: Examine program functionality
- **CLO4**: Evaluate searching and sorting algorithms
- **CLO5**: Develop a cleaner, more efficient, and more manageable Java programs
- **CLO6**: Demonstrate 21st century skills in all learning activities

## Overview
The lab activity/repository covers the following core topics:

- **Control Structures**: Review of loops and conditionals
- **Structured Data Types**: Primitive and non-primitive types
- **File Processing**: Reading and writing files
- **User-Defined Methods, & Classes**: Creating reusable code blocks
- **Recursive Methods**: Implementing recursive solutions
- **Searching Algorithms**: Linear and binary search
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble, selection, and insertion sort
- **OOP Concepts**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism
